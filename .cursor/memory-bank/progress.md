# Progress

## What Works
- A basic Next.js 15 project is set up and running.
- A placeholder landing page exists at `hotdot-landing.tsx`.
- The `memory-bank` is now established and populated with the current project vision.

## What's Left to Build
- **Everything related to the core product:**
  - The new homepage design.
  - The "Daily Challenge" drawing mode.
  - The main drawing canvas/interface.
  - User authentication and profiles.
  - Personal galleries for drawings.
  - The system for challenging friends.
- **A brand new backend:** A complete backend needs to be designed, built, and deployed to support the application's features.

## Current Status
The project is in the **initial design and development phase** of a major pivot. The foundational frontend technology is in place, but the core features that define the product have not yet been built.

## Known Issues
- The legacy backend code in the `/canvas` directory is a major piece of technical debt that should be ignored and eventually removed.
- The current UI flow (`/create`, `/guess`) is a remnant of the old concept and needs to be replaced.
