# Active Context

**Previous Mission (Completed):**
- **Redesign the Homepage:** Reworked the main landing page (`hotdot-landing.tsx`) to align with the new vision of a social drawing game. This included setting up the Figma MCP integration, downloading assets, fixing dependency issues, and implementing the correct fonts.

**Current Mission (Completed):**
- **Fix and Redesign Authentication:**
  - Resolved a critical bug preventing users from authenticating on the Safari browser by reconfiguring cookie handling in the Supabase middleware.
  - Implemented a new two-tab magic link sign-in flow. The user initiates login on one tab, clicks the link in their email which opens a second tab to confirm authentication, and the original tab automatically detects the successful session and redirects.

**Next Mission:**
- **Implement Daily Challenges:** Create the new primary game mode, where users can participate in a new drawing challenge each day.

**Active Branch:** `main`

**Recent Key Decisions:**
- The authentication flow was redesigned to provide a smoother user experience, separating the action of clicking the magic link from the page where the user is actively waiting to be logged in.
- The project's core concept has been clarified: it is a social drawing game, not a "Hot or Cold" game.
- The existing backend has been officially deprecated and will be ignored for all new development.
- Development will focus on the frontend first, hosted on Vercel.
