# Active Context

**Current Mission:**
1.  **Redesign the Homepage:** Rework the main landing page (`hotdot-landing.tsx`) to align with the new vision of a social drawing game.
2.  **Implement Daily Challenges:** Create the new primary game mode, where users can participate in a new drawing challenge each day.

**Active Branch:** `new_home`

**Recent Key Decisions:**
- The project's core concept has been clarified: it is a social drawing game, not a "Hot or Cold" game.
- The existing backend has been officially deprecated and will be ignored for all new development.
- Development will focus on the frontend first, hosted on Vercel.
