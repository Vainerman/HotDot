# Tech Context

## Frontend
- **Framework:** Next.js 15
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **UI:** React 19, Tailwind CSS
- **Component Library:** `shadcn/ui` (built on Radix UI)
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## Backend
- **Status: Deprecated & Slated for Redesign.**
- The previous backend implementation (Docker, Flask, PostgreSQL, Socket.IO) is **to be ignored**. It does not reflect the current or future direction of the project.
- A new backend will need to be designed and built to support features like user accounts, galleries, and challenges.

## Development Environment
- The primary development workflow is to run the Next.js frontend locally using `npm run dev`.
- The backend is not currently part of the active development environment.
