# Product Context

**The Problem:** Friends and creative individuals often lack simple, engaging platforms to share small, fun artistic moments without the pressure of creating a masterpiece.

**Our Solution:** HotDot is a drawing game that lowers the barrier to creativity. It allows users to:
- Start with a simple template (a "hot dot" or a basic shape).
- Create their own unique doodle or drawing.
- Save their creations to a personal gallery.
- Challenge friends, turning art into a lighthearted social activity.

**User Experience Goals:**
- **Fun & Playful:** The experience should feel like a game, not a professional art tool.
- **Simple & Accessible:** Anyone should be able to pick it up and start drawing immediately.
- **Creative & Expressive:** While simple, the tool should allow for a high degree of creativity.
- **Social & Collaborative:** The core loop should encourage sharing and interaction between users.
